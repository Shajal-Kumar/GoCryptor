# GoCryptor - A Go Based File Encryptor

This project is written in Go with the aim to learn more about the language while building something that can help in securing files with basic encryption techniques.

To Encrypt:
```bash
$ go run . encrypt <File Name>
```

To Decrypt:
```bash
$ go run . decrypt <File Name>
```

I hope you have as much fun using this tool as I had building it!
